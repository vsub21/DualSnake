# DualSnake

A project I initially worked on in the summer of 2012 at Digital Media Academy over the period of five days. I have decided that I am going to be revamping this small game I made over 3 years ago and apply what I have learned about Java having taken COMS W1007 and learned more about proper object-oriented design in Java.

The concept of the game is simple; there are two snakes, one red and one blue, each of which can be controlled using the WASD and arrow keys respectively. The goal is to collect the "fruit" that is randomly spawned within the arena without crashing into the walls of the arena, yourself, or the other snake. Collecting a piece of fruit increases the size of your snake.

This game is meant to be played with either one player controlling both snakes (a quite challenging feat) or with two players cooperatively.

Coded in Java and runs as an applet. To run, navigate Terminal/CMD to DualSnake/src and type "appletviewer DualSnake.java".
